# NewProject: Sending Mass Emails:
This is a python-based written program for sending unlimited emails all in one code within less than a sec. It's a mere code without any user interface, hence it needs a prior coding exposure for that not feeling stranger here, so be related. As guidance, you'd use the file with the name of (send.py) to send the msg_tamplete that you can fill up to your way to go.
